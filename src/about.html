                The whole thing is crazy. Every single man in our emerging country was
                out for himself against all others--for his safety, his profit, his future. He had little
                care for the land; he ripped it, raped it, and in some cases destroyed it. He cut
                and burned the forests, fired and plowed the plains, dredged the beautiful rivers
                for gold, leaving a pebbled devastation. When his family grew up about him he
                set it against all other families. When communities arose, each one defended
                itself against other communities. The provinces which became states were each
                one a suspicious unit, with jealously held borders and duties, tolls, and penalties
                against strangers. The surges of the new restless, needy, and strong--grudgingly
                brought in for purposes of hard labor and cheap wages--were resisted, resented,
                and accepted only when a new and different wave came in. Consider how the
                Germans clotted for self-defense until the Irish took the resented place; how the
                Irish became &quot;Americans&quot; against the Poles, the Slavs against the Italians. On
                the West Coast the Chinese ceased to be enemies only when the Japanese
                arrived, and they in the face of the invasion of Hindus, Filipinos, and Mexicans.
                Nor were the dislikes saved exclusively for foreigners. When dust and economics
                rooted up the poor dirt farmers of Oklahoma and pushed them westward, they
                were met with perhaps even more suspicion and resentment than the other
                waves.
